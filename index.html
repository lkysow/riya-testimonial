<h1>Riya Testimonial</h1>
<p>
  I am thrilled to share my heartfelt testimonial for Riya, an exceptional software engineer whose dedication and
  passion for leveraging technology for social good truly set her apart. Having had the pleasure of knowing Riya for
  several years, I have witnessed her incredible journey at Wave Mobile Money and her commitment to making a
  positive impact through her work.
</p>
<p>
  Riya's impressive 4-year tenure at Wave Mobile Money speaks volumes about her technical prowess and leadership
  capabilities. Starting as a Software Engineer, she quickly climbed the ranks, transitioning into the role of Tech
  Lead, and eventually becoming a Senior Software Engineer. Her journey showcases her unwavering commitment to
  personal growth and innovation within the industry.
</p>
<p>
  Riya's current role involves developing software to support Wave Mobile Money's agent network, a critical
  initiative aimed at creating financial infrastructure for the unbanked population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Her
  dedication to this noble cause is truly inspiring, as she actively contributes to building a more inclusive and
  equitable financial ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  Her journey began during her academic years at the University of Alberta, where she completed her Bachelor's in
  Computer Software Engineering. Riya's commitment to excellence was evident even then, as she engaged in various
  extracurricular activities, from hackathons to volunteer work, showcasing her well-rounded skill set and a desire
  to make a difference.
</p>
<p>
  Riya's impact goes beyond her professional accomplishments. Her volunteer experiences as VP of Student Life and
  Associate Vice President of Events at the Engineering Students' Society highlight her exceptional leadership
  abilities and commitment to fostering a sense of community. Creating opportunities for fellow students to engage
  in charity work and volunteer experiences demonstrates her passion for giving back.
</p>
<p>
  What truly stands out about Riya is her ability to blend technical expertise with a deep sense of social
  responsibility. Her work at Wave Mobile Money, particularly in developing solutions for the unbanked population,
  showcases her commitment to utilizing her skills for the betterment of society. Riya's journey is a testament to
  her dedication, innovation, and unwavering belief in the power of technology to drive positive change. She is not
  just a software engineer; she is a trailblazer on a mission to make the world a better place through her work. I
  am confident that her journey is only the beginning of an incredible legacy of impact and inspiration. In fact, I can
  recall a specific time when Riya's resounding belief in technology was made evident, when she thought she could
  lock our front door by saying "Okay Google, lock".
</p>
<p>
  Riya is not only a remarkable professional but also a genuinely good person. Her great wit and quick thinking bring
  joy to those around her, and while she may not be as fast as me, her determination and drive are truly
  commendable. It's also fascinating to know that she enjoys clothes made out of neoprene, showcasing her unique style
  and interests. Additionally, Riya boasts a bottomless pit of a stomach and an undeniable love for food, which adds to
  her delightful and multifaceted personality.
