    I am thrilled to share my heartfelt testimonial for Riya, an exceptional software engineer whose dedication and
    passion for leveraging technology for social good truly set her apart. Having had the pleasure of knowing Riya for
    several years, I have witnessed her incredible journey at Wave Mobile Money and her commitment to making a
    positive impact through her work.

<p>
    Riya's impressive 4-year tenure at Wave Mobile Money speaks volumes about her technical prowess and leadership
    capabilities. Starting as a Software Engineer, she quickly climbed the ranks, transitioning into the role of Tech
    Lead, and eventually becoming a Senior Software Engineer. Her journey showcases her unwavering commitment to
    personal growth and innovation within the industry.
</p>
<p>
    Riya's current role involves developing software to support Wave Mobile Money's agent network, a critical
    initiative aimed at creating financial infrastructure for the unbanked population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Her
    dedication to this noble cause is truly inspiring, as she actively contributes to building a more inclusive and
    equitable financial ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    Her journey began during her academic years at the University of Alberta, where she completed her Bachelor's in
    Computer Software Engineering. Riya's commitment to excellence was evident even then, as she engaged in various
    extracurricular activities, from hackathons to volunteer work, showcasing her well-rounded skill set and a desire
    to make a difference.
</p>
<p>
    Riya's impact goes beyond her professional accomplishments. Her volunteer experiences as VP of Student Life and
    Associate Vice President of Events at the Engineering Students' Society highlight her exceptional leadership
    abilities and commitment to fostering a sense of community. Creating opportunities for fellow students to engage
    in charity work and volunteer experiences demonstrates her passion for giving back.
</p>
<p>
    What truly stands out about Riya is her ability to blend technical expertise with a deep sense of social
    responsibility. Her work at Wave Mobile Money, particularly in developing solutions for the unbanked population,
    showcases her commitment to utilizing her skills for the betterment of society. Riya's journey is a testament to
    her dedication, innovation, and unwavering belief in the power of technology to drive positive change. She is not
    just a software engineer; she is a trailblazer on a mission to make the world a better place through her work. I
    am confident that her journey is only the beginning of an incredible legacy of impact and inspiration.
